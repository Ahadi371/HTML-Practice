            School Life is the best time of our life as we make new friends,
            learn new things and build our career there. School time is the only
            time which we enjoy most, and when we enter college, we always miss
            our school life. School life teaches us lots of new things and
            prepares us to face all the challenges of life. I love my school
            life and really enjoy it. I have lots of friends, and all my
            teachers love me. I love my school and enjoy going there every day
            to meet my friends and learn new things. Everyone keeps on saying
            that school life is the best time of your life. When listening to
            these phrases from their elders, the school students think about
            what is good about this life. All we do in the entire day is to
            attend the classes and to do the homework. But once school life gets
            over, the students realise that school life was the best time of
            their life.
